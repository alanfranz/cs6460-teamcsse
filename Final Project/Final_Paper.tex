\section{Abstract}
 New graduates from computer science and software engineering programs do not always possess required skills or knowledge when they join their first job in industry. Are there any misaligned expectations between industry and educational system? The purpose of this research is to discover the misaligned expectations between industry and school system among four different categories: 1) undergraduate students, 2) post-graduate students, 3) teachers and professors, and 4) industry professionals. We also look into the possible solutions that helps to reduce the resulting skill gap and the role of online graduate-level programs on resolving the issue. We provided a questionnaire to compare the opinion of participants in each category on educational achievements and ideal goals, chances of getting hired after graduation and becoming fully proficient in that job, and how related job experience can affect the employment and job proficiency. Interestingly, the results indicate that all four categories think similarly in terms of new graduate's achievements and would-like achievements. However, there is an agreement on existence of misalignment between university goals and industry expectations. The research describe the important role of job experience. The possible suggested solutions to better prepare the fresh graduates for industry are internships, part-time jobs, and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC), which brings various benefits to students.
  
\section{Introduction}
There is a widespread agreement that new graduates from computer science and software engineering \textbf{do not always possess required skills, abilities or knowledge when joining the tech industry}: a lot of entry-level jobs actually require three years of experience \cite{Chakrabarti2018}; gaps between Engineering Education, and Practice (what an engineer does in real life) do exist \cite{Sivanesan2017}; the software industry presents dissatisfaction in relation to the level of recently graduated professionals \cite{Portela2017}; there is considerable room for improvement in what is taught to software students [in relation with job relevance] \cite{Lethbridgea}; many employers find that graduates and sandwich students come to them poorly prepared for the every day problems encountered at the workplace \cite{Dawson2000}.

Some universities and programs even took steps to try and fix this problem in some specific classes by doing all kind of things: from purposely hindering and disrupting the software development processes \cite{Dawson2000}, to adapting and incorporating industry training strategies into a software engineering course \cite{Portela2017}, to creating and adapting a project-based software engineering course that led the students to face with current, real-world engineering problems \cite{Delgado2017}, and to highlight to students how relevant is having and developing critical soft skills to succeed in projects\cite{Bastarrica2017}.

At first, we thought that different outcomes could come from different programs, so we explored the difference between Computer Science and Software Engineering programs, but those didn't prove really relevant; the official ACM/IEEE curricula for Computer Science \cite{Force2013} and Software Engineering \cite{Ardis2015}, which many universities base their program on, are somewhat overlapping, and some studies trying to highlight differences in outcomes between CS and SE graduates were mostly inconclusive: a lot of core competencies are shared \cite{Meziane2004} \cite{Rasool2014}. And, those recently-updated curricula don't seem to incorporate lessons from the aforementioned efforts.

The acknowledgment of this skill gap and the efforts to train new graduates for the industry go back as far as 1992 \cite{Dawson1992}. So, \textbf{if in a quarter of a century little to nothing changed, what is the real matter}?

\section{Research questions}
We have two sets of questions. In the first set, our main question is: \textbf{does the perceived skill gap in fresh graduates exist because the academy is unable to provide a good training, or just because a) the academy is not even trying to do that kind of job, and b) the industry is taking that kind of job for granted, or c) the students think they should be getting something that the university has no intention to provide them with?} Here, we ask what could be the reasons that there exist a gap between students, professors, and industry professionals' expectations. We will look into these questions for both \textbf{undergraduate} and \textbf{post-graduate} level students that are recently graduated from school. We also ask the question that \textbf{how the students' degree can improve the chance of getting hired? Do the graduate-level studies help the students to gain adaptive skills in industry more quickly?}\newline
In the second set of our questions, we are asking \textbf{what would be the best solutions that bring the university and industry's objectives closer to each other?} 

\section{The hypothesis}
We think that:
\begin{itemize}
\item Most students, when picking their major, have little to no idea what they're going to actually study, and they probably expect to learn mostly about programming and creating applications;
\item Most teachers, when designing their courses, think about teaching what they deem useful to achieve the so-called \textit{computational thinking} in their students;
\item Most professionals and employers, when hiring fresh graduates, expect they'll be able to immediately and fully carry out whatever real-world task is assigned to them.
\end{itemize}

So, we provide two sets of hypothesis to approach the research questions.

\textbf{Hypothesis 1}: One of the reasons for the perceived skill gap is that all those that should - in an employer's view - care for learning some skills to be used at work, don't actually have that aim during their education phase. In other words, the misaligned expectations between industry and university causes the skill gap. Those skills have impact on job proficiency and possibilities to get hired. We think that the expectations among four groups differ. These four groups are composed of \textbf{undergraduate-level students, post-graduate-level students, educators and school staff, and industry professionals}. The main problem is not only that one side hasn’t enough resources or skills to achieve a certain goal, but, rather, that there’s a different vision or gaol on what should be done, and different and unaligned \textit{rewards} exist for different groups.  

\textbf{Hypothesis 2}:  We think that the following hypothesis is that the graduate-level studies, on the contrary, can play an important role on reducing the skill gap between industry and university, and therefore, can be considered as one good resolution for that issue. More specifically, we think that \textbf{high-quality online graduate-level programs} such as Georgia Tech OMSCS (Online Master of Science in Computer Science) are quite aligned with industry expectations. These such programs also target many people from all over the world, who can become proficient in their job quickly as well as being active in an academic environment.

\section{Research Methodology}
It would be great to have one-on-one interviews with a lot of people, and ask them what were their expectations before starting their degree and after getting it, to understand professionals' point of view, and to try to understand what teachers and university staff designing courses is actually trying to do; but, that would involve an important amount of time, both for the researchers and all the people involved.

Still, we leveraged modern technology to achieve something useful; we \textbf{created a survey} where we asked questions to assess the thoughts of students ( post-graduate and undergraduate level), university teachers, and industry professionals to discover what it is, in their opinion, the current goal of university degrees (both Bachelor's degrees and Master's degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering or whatever a similar degree is called in one's country), and how that affects job proficiency and chances of being hired. Following this, we provided open-ended questions in the last section of the survey that participants would share their thoughts on possible solutions on how to reduce the skill gap caused by misaligned expectations. In this last section, we also pointed out graduate-level online programs as a possible solution and asked them what would be the benefits of such programs on resolving the described issue.

 Once we collected the data, we split our data into two parts. In the first part we focused on investigating the expectation gap and the in second part we focused on finding the possible solutions to reduce the skill gap. We used \textbf{quantitative} and \textbf{qualitative} analysis to describe the results. We applied the quantitative approach for the first part of our investigations and uncovered patterns that highlighted the relations between some of our variables. We used R programming to analyze our data. In the second part of our survey data analysis, which focused on finding best solutions to the issue, we qualitatively analyzed the open-ended questions. This qualitative analysis helped us to understand the motivations and opinions on solving the problem. 

In summary, we looked into the misaligned expectations among universities and industry, and following that, we focused on some possible solutions to resolve this phenomena. \newline

Below, is a list of variables we provided questions in our survey.

\textit{Independent variables}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Category: CS/SE undergraduate student, CS/SE post-graduate students, CS/SE professor/teacher/university staff, industry professional in the tech/software field;
	\item Age;
	\item Country of residence;
	\item Country where somebody got his/her degree (if any);
	\item Highest completed educational degree;
	\item Previous programming skills or actual job experience in the tech/software field before starting university;
	\item If employed, company size and tech department size;
\end{itemize}

\textit{Dependent variables:}

All the variables are related to CS/SE bachelor's/master's degree fresh graduates.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Self-reported current goal for bachelor's/master's degree: what they think that university aims at, right now;
	\item Self-reported ideal goal for bachelor's/master's degree: what they wish that university would do, if different from current;
	\item Self-reported expected GPA relevance for actual job proficiency;
	\item Self-reported university ranking relevance - how the ranking of a well-known university can impact the job qualification?
	\item Self-reported expected (or actual, for professionals) time to achieve full job proficiency when entering the industry?
	\item Self-reported expected time to land the first job for a current fresh graduate?
	\item Self-reported chances of getting hired for new graduates with no previous working experience (both post-graduate and undergraduate levels);
	\item Self-reported top skill which they think would be useful at a job that can't be taught at school (if any);
	\item Self-reported expected proficiency of BS graduates versus practitioners with a relevant work experience in the same ballpark (~4 years) but without a degree, when getting a job;
	\item Self-reported expected proficiency of BS graduates versus practitioners with a relevant work experience in the same ballpark (~4 years) but without a degree, right after getting a job;
	\item Self-reported expected proficiency of BS graduates versus practitioners with a relevant work experience in the same ballpark (~4 years) but without a degree, after one years of being hired;
	\item Self-reported expected proficiency of MS graduates versus practitioners with a relevant work experience in the same ballpark (~2 years) and having a BS degree, when getting a job;
	\item Self-reported expected proficiency of MS graduates versus practitioners with a relevant work experience in the same ballpark (~2 years) and having a BS degree, right after getting a job;
	\item Self-reported expected proficiency of BS graduates versus practitioners with a relevant work experience in the same ballpark (~2 years) and having a BS degree, after one years of being hired;
	\item Self-reported possible solutions to reduce the expected skill gap between industry and universities for new graduates; 
	\item Self-reported role of online high-quality graduate level programs in reducing the skill gap - how programs like Georgia Tech OMSCS (Online Master  of Science in Computer Science) can help to solve this issue?
\end{itemize}
 What we perceived is novel, where \textbf{we target all categories at the same time}, so we can put their answers in perspective.

\section{Recruitment}
Since we liked to get a good sample, we created a website, where we described what we are doing, provided links to the survey, and shared the website with different groups; We put our results and the provided graphs from our data analysis on the website to present our work. The main purpose of our website is to easily share the goal and description of our research with many people, provide the survey link in the website, and make it a platform that we can share and present our results with whoever is interested to see the results. Any participant could subscribe to our website, if interested, and they get the result explanations at the end of the research period. We used Google Forms as the tool to provide our survey questions and collected the results.  

 We used social media as one of the platforms to share our website and get to the numbers of participants we need. We also asked our classmates to share the website as much as they can, and we asked each survey-taker to share it as well, especially to categories that are different than himself (e.g. "Share this survey with your professors!")

\section{Results}
Surprisingly, we've found that the expectations don't seem to be that misaligned on many topics. All of our categories, for example, have got very similar opinions on most BScgraduate skills and would-like skills. With one interesting twist.

\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{../data-analysis/plots_output/BSc_graduate_reported_achievements_by_category.png}

\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{../data-analysis/plots_output/BSc_graduate_would-like_achievements_by_category.png}

We can see that most of our respondents, regardless of their category, think that a BSc graduate achieves the so-called \textit{computational thinking}, and, secondarily, a certain hireability and some programming skills. 

Here, we can actually see a bit of contrast between two categories : the teachers, and the industry professionals. The former think that programming is something a BSc graduate definitely acquires; the latter, being the ones that actually employ such skills, are far more reluctant to say that it's something you get in university.

About the would-like skills, there're not great surprises; it seems that the most interesting that aren't achieved at university we find real-world problem solving, soft skills, and, somewhat, project management - undergrads seem especially uninterested in this latest skills!

But, one surprise comes from programming. It's not marked as a clear achievement but most respondent, and \textbf{neither it is marked as a desiderata}. How should somebody hone his programming skills?

The other surprise comes from research skills. Teachers don't think it's something that is taught, and neither that it should be taught. Possibly, that's left to graduate education?\newline

\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{../data-analysis/plots_output/MSc_graduate_reported_achievements_by_category.png}

\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{../data-analysis/plots_output/MSc_graduate_would-like_achievements_by_category.png}

Here we see the opinions about graduate education. It appears to be a partial solution for some parts of undergrad education... but not completely. Most people \textit{but industry professionals} would agree that an MSc improves your programming skills; since industry professionals are actually the most qualified at such opinion, it's not really encouraging, since they estimate MSc graduates abilities on par with BSc abilities. Programming is hard!

We see better results for research: a reasonable amount of respondents think that graduate education is the  stage at which research skills are taught.

But real-word problem solving is still an open problem, even after a Master's; and soft skills, along project management, could fare much better; there seem to be a large amount of teachers that agree on the fact that Master's graduates would need more skills that can be applied directly in the real world.

We can see more traces of this belief in another answer:

\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{../data-analysis/plots_output/Industry_readiness_with_relation_to_job_experience.png}

Only a few undergrads hope that, at the end of their four-year journey, they'll be able to enter the workforce and just have a great career. Other categories mostly believe that an apprenticeship phase will be mandatory for everybody - in this phase, most probably our graduates will learn about \textbf{soft skills, project management, real-world problem solving, and.... actual programming!}.

This idea is reinforced by other answers in our survey; when discussing hireability, we asked our respondents to compare experienced and unexperienced candidates with and without degrees:

\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{../data-analysis/plots_output/BSc_degree_versus_job_experience_hireability.png}
%TODO: verify this graph: it seems a bit off, some categories seem to sum to more than 100%

\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{../data-analysis/plots_output/MSc_degree_versus_BSC_and_job_experience_hireability.png}

As we can see, a large majority thinks that experience matters, and it matters a lot. Interestingly, teachers seem that experience is even more important, probably acknowledging the industry-school gap and our supposed misalignment.

One last interesting find is about the proficiency of both BSc and MSc graduates short-term and long-term job proficiency:

\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{../data-analysis/plots_output/BSc_degree_versus_job_experience_short-term_proficiency.png}

\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{../data-analysis/plots_output/BSc_degree_versus_job_experience_long-term_proficiency.png}

\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{../data-analysis/plots_output/MSc_degree_versus_BSC_and_job_experience_short-term_proficiency.png}

\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{../data-analysis/plots_output/MSc_degree_versus_BSC_and_job_experience_long-term_proficiency.png}

Here, we can see two things:
\begin{itemize}
\item In the short term, experience trumps a degree.
\item In the long term, a degree doesn't necessarily mean a better worker.	
\end{itemize}

While the first statement may be a bit expected, we think that the second is clearly a novelty; even teachers don't acknowledge a clear advantage for graduates at doing their job. This is quite a clear image of the misalignment: there seems to be at least a slight indication that people in the academy don't really think that a lot of the things they teach are \textit{that} useful for the modern industry, neither about the topics (short-term proficiency) or the \textit{forma mentis} (long-term proficiency).

We have seen quite scattered responses about the impact of GPAs and top schools, and we don't think we can draw big conclusions about those topics; feel free to browse our data and graphs if you want to know more.

\section{Limitations}
 We think our research has several limitations.\newline

First: we didn't get as many respondents as we would have liked. We got about half the respondents we'd have liked to see; we miss statistical power.\newline

Second: our categories are quite polarized. We have got a lot of industry professionals and graduate students, but we lack teachers and undergraduate students. Surely those few undegrrads and teachers' opinion has a disproportionate effect in our analysis. \newline

Third: most of our respondents come from the US. We don't think this research can have a worldwide validity, it's probably just one view of the problem.\newline

Fourth: we had initially missed (an error while converting a document to Google Forms) a fundamental question in our survey (the category). Since we knew some of the respondents, we have inferred the categories for our analysis' sake for a small set of initial respondents (the survey was later amended).\newline

Various people (in online forums where we had spread our survey as well) told us one interesting point about the hireability section: the experience, or the degree, only matter up to a point in order to be \textit{hired}, because the interview will always trump the credentials. It may matter in order \textit{to get an interview}: if we ever replicate this survey, it would be better to substitute "hireability" with "chances to land an interview".

\section{Conclusions}
About our two main hypotheses, we could say that:

For the first hypothesis, we could say that collected data \textit{partially supports} it. Undergrad programs aren't meant to teach project management, problem solving, or soft skills, while a lot of people would just love to see Bachelors graduate with such abilities; so, there's a misalignment between the intentions of the industry and of the researchers. Interestingly, most undergrad students seem fully aware of the situation.

Programming, on the contrary, seems a matter of teaching abilities. It seems that schools are unable to create good programmers. But then, most people just seem to think that apprenticeship and on-the-job training are not replaceable by pure education; maybe we should just accept that we're yet unable to abstract away that kind of learning from real-world experience, and we should scale down students (and employers!) expectations about new graduates: they won't be good programmers without an appropriate on-the-job training.

The graduate education part appears to be a bit more foggy. We supposed that graduate-level programs would better fill the school-industry gap, but we cannot say that this is the case. Most of the industry is not concerned with research, and most industry professionals don't see great programming skills in MSc graduates. For sure, it's a beginning, it's something more than basic BSc education; but, probably, spending the same amount of time on a real job would yield the same results about soft skills, real-world problem solving and project management.

\section{Possible Future Works}
We think it would be very interesting to replicate the experiment on a different scale, with slightly different premises. \textbf{Recruitment} seems to be the hardest part of our research; it would be interesting to partner with some large organizations (be it companies, conferences, universities) in order to push a (similar) survey to them.

It would be interesting to investigate the concept of good programmers, as well. Do bootcamps/MOOCs/other kind of programs produce better coders than university? Are they on par, but within a shorter timeframe? Could the university improve something?

It may be interesting to check if multiple categories (e.g. industry professionals that are MSc students as well) have significantly different answers from "bare" categories; this was a bit outside the scope of our analysis because of time constraints and because of the polarization of our respondents, but could be quite useful.

It would be very useful to get more data from the academy. We haven't seen a clear indication for the purpose of the higher education programs; we may say that they appear a bit confused on whether it would like to focus on research, or it would like to help more the industry, or would just pursue knowledge for knowledge's sake - which could be a totally valid purpose!
