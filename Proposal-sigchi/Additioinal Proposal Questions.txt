Additional thoughts on project proposal:

1- Does the higher education in graduate level reduce this gap? 

2- Are the goals of graduate level students closer to industry expectations?

3- Do the professors train the students in graduate level to be prepared in practical activities instead of research based education?

4- Does online graduate level education help the student to be prepared for industry more quickly?

5- Why online high-quality master's program such as OMSCS born? How does it benefit students with fun-time job? How it affects students during their studies to improve the rehired skills in industry?
Georgia Tech has a page regarding "Why OMSCS? :  "https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/explore-oms-cs"

6- what are some of the benefits of studying in an online program such as OMSCS and the on-campus program? How one can compare these two with each other? Which one can make the goals of students, professors and industry professionals more close to each other? Why?
