Ideas for tasks and milestones:

- website: create a website that explains the purpose of the research and links to the survey. I think this is important to enlarge the audience (a random link to google forms on the web is not the same). Also, the website should explain all the privacy things.
- survey: think about all the questions for all the possible categories (teachers, students, professionals, ... ? hr? recruiters - ok, think about the categories)
* those due items could be milestone1


- validate the survey with same small sample for each category, so that we don't forget something important
- build the survey with the proper tool. Does Google Forms work out? if not, look at another survey.
- think about an opt-in "keep in touch" feature, maybe setup a mailchimp mailing list for people that want to know what we do find in the research
- share the survey! spam everybody! adwords, forums, blogs, everybody must know!
* those items could be milestone2

- create something to analyze/graph the data that then must be put in the paper; since we're mostly descriptive, we don't really need to draw big conclusions
- project paper: put doen 
- project presentation
