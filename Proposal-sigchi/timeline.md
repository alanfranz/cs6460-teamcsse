What we want to achieve?
essentially: nothing. the hypothesis is that there's a misalignment between expectations of students, employers, and teachers in higher education (Bachelor and Master). We're quite confident in saying that there IS a gap between what a fresh graduate sshould know and what actually knows, but possibly

1) university has no interest or incentive in filling up that gap
2) employers don't know a better way. they use university as a signal system because other signals are just... weaker?
3) employers don't know how to teach
4) students have no idea what they want. why do students enter a SE/CS program? What do they expect? Would they pick more industry-aligned courses if those were available?


Questions we're trying to answer in our research?:
- what's the purpose of CS/SE? Do they teach software engineering or computational thinking, really? Do they teach anything, or do employers find CS/SE graduates just worthless? If they do, why they keep hiring them (if they do)? Maybe university actually teaches something, and that something IS useful to graduates, but something is still missing.
- Does an employer prefer somebody with a degree, or somebody without a degree but the same amount of experience?


Limitations:
- it would be great to do some study that verifies some conceptions. Does a CS/SE graduate gain something from its BS, or not?maybe computational thinking or engineering approach is more useful than expected.

Ideas for tasks and milestone:

- website: create a website that explains the purpose of the research and links to the survey. I think this is important to enlarge the audience (a random link to google forms on the web is not the same). Also, the website should explain all the privacy things.
- survey: think about all the questions for all the possible categories (teachers, students, professionals, ... ? hr? recruiters - ok, think about the categories) -> this is gonna be hard enough to get a good draft
* those due items could be milestone1


- validate the survey with same small sample for each category, so that we don't forget something important
- build the survey with the proper tool. Does Google Forms work out? if not, look at another survey.
- think about an opt-in "keep in touch" feature, maybe setup a mailchimp mailing list for people that want to know what we do find in the research
- share the survey! spam everybody! adwords, forums, blogs, everybody must know! -> I think this will be a very time consuming task!
* those items could be milestone2

- create something to analyze/graph the data that then must be put in the paper; since we're mostly descriptive, we don't really need to draw big conclusions
- project paper: put doen 
- project presentation
