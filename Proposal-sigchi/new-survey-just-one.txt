Introduction: who should take this survey?
* CS/SE/other information technology program students at all levels (Bachelor, Master's, PhD)
* Working professionals in the software/tech sector, including managers, recruiters, etc.
* Teachers for CS / SE / other information technology programs and classes

If not in those categories: thanks, but don't take this survey


Some terminology:
dropdown: choose one answer from some possible choices. Most should include a "don't know/prefer not to say" option and an "other" choice with an open field
checkbox: choose zero or more answers from some possible choices, most should include an "other" choice with open field.
open: write whatever you like
autocomplete list: write whatever you like, but with autocompletion


1 - checkbox with: (undergrad student, graduate/phd/after bachelor student, teacher/staff, tech industry professional)
- Age (dropdown with ranges)
- Country you work in (autocomplete list)
- If holding a university degree, country you got it (autocomplete list)
- Highest completed education degree (High School/BS/After-BS) (dropdown)
- If employed: size of the company + size of the company tech department (how many developers/techies)? dropdown with ranges



**** Quantitative survey: Misaligned Expectations Survey ****

IF NOT SPECIFIED, questions are DROPDOWN for this section


2- currently, what do you think a BACHELOR's student in computer science or software engineering achieves, 
when he/she graduates? (checkbox)
* he/she learns programming very well
* he/she learns computational thinking
* he/she learns project management
* he/she learns real-world problem solving handling industry-type problems
* he/she learns how to be a researcher
* he/she gets very good soft skills (communication, teamwork, etc)
* he/she gets credentials to get a good job
* Other - please specify

3- Is there any skill, that you think a BACHELOR's student would need to learn at university and are essential in working industryt? (checkbox)

+++ 4- Is there any skill, that you think is superfluous for BACHELOR's student to learn at university? (same choices as above) (checkbox)

5- How do you think the BS GPA affects a fresh BS graduate to get hired?
* I think it's not relevant
* I think that an high GPA is totally essential to getting a great first job
* I think that a low GPA discourages employers/recruiters, but from a certain threshold onwards employers tend not to care about it
* The higher the GPA, the easier to get a great first job, the effect is quite linear.

6- How do you think the school choice (e.g. Top 10/Ivy League university vs random college) affects a fresh BS graduate to get hired?
* I think it's not relevant
* I think that a top-tier school is a key to getting a great first job
* I think a top-tier school gives a graduate a bit of a boost, but it's not essential


7- How do you think the BS GPA affects a fresh BS graduate's professional proficiency?
* I think it's not relevant, BS GPA and first job performance are quite disconnected
* I think that an high GPA is totally essential to performing fine at a first job
* I think that low GPA graduates perform badly, but from average to top GPAs you can't see much of a difference
* The higher the GPA, the better a graduate performs on his job.

8- How do you think the school choice (e.g. Top 10/Ivy League university vs random college) affects a fresh BS graduate's professional proficiency?
* I think it's not relevant
* I think that a top-tier school makes a graduate fundamentally better at his/her job
* I think a top-tier school gives a graduate a bit of a boost, but it's not essential

9- How long do you think a fresh BS graduate will need in order to land his/her first job, after graduation?
* I believe most of them already have an offer before graduation/after interning
* 1-3 months
* 3-6 months
* 6-12 months
* more than one year

10- How long do you think a fresh BS graduate will need in order to become fully proficient at his/her first job, after being hired?
* 0-3 months
* 3-12 months
* 12-24 months
* more than two years

+++ 11- If you choose anything else than '0-3 months', please tell us why do you think a fresh graduate will need that much time (what skills
he's learning):
(open question)


<REPEAT SAME QUESTIONS FOR MASTER'S DEGREES, but suppose that such student hasn't got into industry before getting back to school>:
Repeat questions: 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11

12- Consider two candidates for the same job. One holds a 4-year BS degree and no job experience. The other has no degree, but
has four years job experience in a similar role. What do you think about the candidates' *hireability*?
* I think that the BS candidate will stand more chances
* I think the experienced candidate will stand more chances
* I think they're more or less equal from an hireability point of view

13- Consider two fresh hires for the same position at the same company. One holds a 4-year BS degree and no job experience. The other has no degree, but
has four years job experience in a similar role. What do you think about the candidates' *skills* RIGHT AFTER BEING HIRED?
* I think that the BS candidate will perform much better; better quality, and faster work.
* I think that the experienced candidate will perform much better; better quality, and faster work.
* They'll perform more or less the same.

14- Consider two fresh hires for the same position at the same company. One holds a 4-year BS degree and no job experience. The other has no degree, but
has four years job experience in a similar role. They work at the company, in the same role, for one year. What do you think about the candidates' skills and career at that time?
* I think that the BS candidate will perform much better; better quality, and faster work. He'll probably have reached a better position in the company.
* I think that the experienced candidate will perform much better; better quality, and faster work. He'll probably have reached a better position in the company.
* They'll perform more or less the same.

hypothesis: BS+MS no work experience ~ same hireability as a plain BS
BS+relevant work experience = more hireability than BS+MS without work experience

15- Consider two candidates for the same job. One holds a relevant MS degree and no job experience. The other has
a BS and 2-years of relevant job experience. What do you think about the candidates' *hireability*?
* I think that the MS candidate will stand more chances
* I think the BS experienced candidate will stand more chances
* I think they're more or less equal from an hireability point of view

16- Consider two fresh hires for the same position at the same company. One holds a relevant MS degree and no job experience. The other has a BS degree, and a couple of years of experience in a similar role. What do you think about the candidates' *skills* RIGHT AFTER BEING HIRED?
* I think that the MS candidate will perform much better; better quality, and faster work.
* I think that the BS experienced candidate will perform much better; better quality, and faster work.
* They'll perform more or less the same.

17- Consider two fresh hires for the same role at the same company. One holds an MS degree and no job experience. The other has a BS degree, and two years job experience in a similar role. They work at the company, in the same role, for one year. What do you think about the candidates' skills and career at that time?
* I think that the MS candidate will perform much better; better quality, and faster work. He'll probably have reached a better position in the company.
* I think that the BS experienced candidate will perform much better; better quality, and faster work. He'll probably have reached a better position in the company.
* They'll perform more or less the same.



**** Qualitative survey: Find the Solution survey *****

if not specified, those are OPEN questions.

18- If you think any skill gaps exists when a student enters the workforce, what do you think would be the solutions to reduce the skill gap for new graduates (both BS and post-graduate levels) entering the work force?

19- In your opinion, how can students gain similar working experience during their *undergraduate* studies, if any? 


20- In your opinion, how can students gain similar working experience during their *graduate* studies, if any? 


21- In your opinion, what would be the benefits of joining a graduate-level *online* program?


22- In your opinion, how a *graduate-level online* program can reduce the skill gap in industry and university for new graduates?


23- In general, which statement is, in your opinion, is more accurate (if we assume both below groups have no previous job experience):
* The undergraduate students are already prepared to join the industry and they do not need a higher post-graduate degree.
* The post-graduate students are more prepared than undergraduate-level students
* Anybody entering the workforce for the first time, regardless of their academic pedigree, will need training and time to get fully proficient.

+++ 24- At what point in the life/career of somebody do you think a graduate program (e.g. a Master's degree) can be most effective from professional proficiency point of view?
* When a student does it straight after getting a Bachelor's
* When a professional does it after working in the industry for some years
* When a professional needs retraining (because of outdated skills or change of work field)
* Not many differences

+++ 25- Which flavour of a graduate program (e.g. a Master's degree) do you think would be most effective from professional proficiency point of view?
* On campus, full time - the grad student does nothing else
* On campus, part time - the grad student keeps his/her job
* Online, full time - the grad student does nothing else
* Online, part time - the grad students keeps his/her job

26- Do you think that there could be valid alternatives to a Master's degree for a professional in need of retraining?
(checkbox)
* Retraining on the job - instead of spending money in university, be a kind of "grownup intern" in some company
* MOOCs
* In-person classes in non-academic institutions (e.g. Bradfield school of computer science)
* Other (open field)

27- Which area you deem most critical for a professional when choosing whether to enter a Master's degree?
* Time. Getting (preferably paid) time off from the employer would matter when entering a program.
* Money. If the employer pays, it would make it much more probable for a professional to enter a program.
* Motivation. The topic should be of high interest, not just a dull, imposed training experience.
* Prestige. Success in the program should be a source of pride.
* Career advancement. Success in the program should be a guarantee of a better position.



<potential ideas>:

- Tell us which of those statements are, in your opinion, true:
(MCQ)
* The tech industry is making a lot of money and it's contributing back very little to the education sector
* The universities should care more about research than practical industry applications
