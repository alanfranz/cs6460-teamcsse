- multiple choice box with: (undergrad student, graduate/phd/after bachelor student, teacher/staff, tech industry professional)
- Age
- Country you work in
- If holding a university degree, country you got it
- Highest completed education degree (High School/BS/After-BS)

-> i think those fields should NOT be mandatory, everybody has the right not to tell us something.

- currently, what do you think a BACHELOR's student in computer science or software engineering achieves, 
when he graduates? (multiple choices)
* he/she learns programming very well
* he/she learns computational thinking
* he/she learns project management
* he/she learns real-world problem solving handling industry-type problems
* he/she learns how to be a researcher
* he/she gets very good soft skills (communication, teamwork, etc)
* he/she gets credentials to get a good job
* Other - please specify

- Is there any skill, that you think a BACHELOR's student would need to learn at university, and doesn't? (same choices as above)

- Is there any skill, that you think is superfluos for BACHELOR's student to learn at university? (same choices as above)

- How do you think the BS GPA affects a fresh BS graduate's hireability?
* I think it's not relevant
* I think that an high GPA is totally essential to getting a great first job
* I think that a low GPA discourages employers/recruiters, but from a certain threshold onwards employers tend not to care about it
* The higher the GPA, the easier to get a great first job, the effect is quite linear.

- How do you think the school choice (e.g. Top 10/Ivy League university vs random college) affects a fresh BS graduate's hireability?
* I think it's not relevant
* I think that a top-tier school is a key to getting a great first job
* I think a top-tier school gives a graduate a bit of a boost, but it's not essential


- How do you think the BS GPA affects a fresh BS graduate's professional proficiency?
* I think it's not relevant, BS GPA and first job performance are quite disconnected
* I think that an high GPA is totally essential to performing fine at a first job
* I think that low GPA graduates perform badly, but from average to top GPAs you can't see much of a difference
* The higher the GPA, the better a graduate performs on his job.

- How do you think the school choice (e.g. Top 10/Ivy League university vs random college) affects a fresh BS graduate's professional proficiency?
* I think it's not relevant
* I think that a top-tier school makes a graduate fundamentally better at his/her job
* I think a top-tier school gives a graduate a bit of a boost, but it's not essential

- How long do you think a fresh BS graduate will need in order to land his first job, after graduation?
* I believe most of them already have an offer before graduation/after interning
* 1-3 months
* 3-6 months
* 6-12 months
* more than one year

- How long do you think a fresh BS graduate will need in order to become fully proficient at his first job, after being hired?
* 0-3 months
* 3-12 months
* 12-24 months
* more than two years

- If you choose anything else than '0-3 months', please tell us why do you think a fresh graduate will need that much time (what skills
he's learning):
(open question)


<REPEAT SAME QUESTIONS FOR MASTER'S DEGREES>

- Consider two candidates for the same job. One holds a 4-year BS degree and no job experience. The other has no degree, but
has four years job experience in a similar role. What do you think about the candidates' hireability?
* I think that the BS candidate will stand more chances
* I think the experienced candidate will stand more chances
* I think they're more or less equal from an hireability point of view

- Consider two fresh hires for the same position at the same company. One holds a 4-year BS degree and no job experience. The other has no degree, but
has four years job experience in a similar role. What do you think about the candidates' skills RIGHT AFTER BEING HIRED?
* I think that the BS candidate will perform much better; better quality, and faster work.
* I think that the experienced candidate will perform much better; better quality, and faster work.
* They'll perform more or less the same.

- Consider two fresh hires for the same position at the same company. One holds a 4-year BS degree and no job experience. The other has no degree, but
has four years job experience in a similar role. What do you think about the candidates' skills right AFTER FOUR YEARS?
* I think that the BS candidate will perform much better; better quality, and faster work. He'll probably have reached a better position in the company.
* I think that the experienced candidate will perform much better; better quality, and faster work. He'll probably have reached a better position in the company.
* They'll perform more or less the same.
