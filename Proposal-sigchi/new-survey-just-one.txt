- checkbox with: (undergrad student, graduate/phd/after bachelor student, teacher/staff, tech industry professional)
- Age
- Country you work in
- If holding a university degree, country you got it
- Highest completed education degree (High School/BS/After-BS)
- If employed: size of the company + size of the company tech department (how many developers/techies)?

-> i think those fields should NOT be mandatory, everybody has the right not to tell us something.

**** Quantitative survey: Misaligned Expectations Survey ****

- currently, what do you think a BACHELOR's student in computer science or software engineering achieves, 
when he/she graduates? (multiple choices)
* he/she learns programming very well
* he/she learns computational thinking
* he/she learns project management
* he/she learns real-world problem solving handling industry-type problems
* he/she learns how to be a researcher
* he/she gets very good soft skills (communication, teamwork, etc)
* he/she gets credentials to get a good job
* Other - please specify

- Is there any skill, that you think a BACHELOR's student would need to learn at university, and they don't? (same choices as above)

- Is there any skill, that you think is superfluos for BACHELOR's student to learn at university? (same choices as above)

- How do you think the BS GPA affects a fresh BS graduate's hireability?
* I think it's not relevant
* I think that an high GPA is totally essential to getting a great first job
* I think that a low GPA discourages employers/recruiters, but from a certain threshold onwards employers tend not to care about it
* The higher the GPA, the easier to get a great first job, the effect is quite linear.

- How do you think the school choice (e.g. Top 10/Ivy League university vs random college) affects a fresh BS graduate's hireability?
* I think it's not relevant
* I think that a top-tier school is a key to getting a great first job
* I think a top-tier school gives a graduate a bit of a boost, but it's not essential


- How do you think the BS GPA affects a fresh BS graduate's professional proficiency?
* I think it's not relevant, BS GPA and first job performance are quite disconnected
* I think that an high GPA is totally essential to performing fine at a first job
* I think that low GPA graduates perform badly, but from average to top GPAs you can't see much of a difference
* The higher the GPA, the better a graduate performs on his job.

- How do you think the school choice (e.g. Top 10/Ivy League university vs random college) affects a fresh BS graduate's professional proficiency?
* I think it's not relevant
* I think that a top-tier school makes a graduate fundamentally better at his/her job
* I think a top-tier school gives a graduate a bit of a boost, but it's not essential

- How long do you think a fresh BS graduate will need in order to land his first job, after graduation?
* I believe most of them already have an offer before graduation/after interning
* 1-3 months
* 3-6 months
* 6-12 months
* more than one year

- How long do you think a fresh BS graduate will need in order to become fully proficient at his first job, after being hired?
* 0-3 months
* 3-12 months
* 12-24 months
* more than two years

- If you choose anything else than '0-3 months', please tell us why do you think a fresh graduate will need that much time (what skills
he's learning):
(open question)

- What are the top 2-3 skills that are not taught at school, but which are essential when working in the industry?
(open question)

<REPEAT SAME QUESTIONS FOR MASTER'S DEGREES, but suppose that such student hasn't got into industry before getting back to school>

- Consider two candidates for the same job. One holds a 4-year BS degree and no job experience. The other has no degree, but
has four years job experience in a similar role. What do you think about the candidates' *hireability*?
* I think that the BS candidate will stand more chances
* I think the experienced candidate will stand more chances
* I think they're more or less equal from an hireability point of view

- Consider two fresh hires for the same position at the same company. One holds a 4-year BS degree and no job experience. The other has no degree, but
has four years job experience in a similar role. What do you think about the candidates' *skills* RIGHT AFTER BEING HIRED?
* I think that the BS candidate will perform much better; better quality, and faster work.
* I think that the experienced candidate will perform much better; better quality, and faster work.
* They'll perform more or less the same.

- Consider two fresh hires for the same position at the same company. One holds a 4-year BS degree and no job experience. The other has no degree, but
has four years job experience in a similar role. They work at the company, in the same role, for one year. What do you think about the candidates' skills and career at that time?
* I think that the BS candidate will perform much better; better quality, and faster work. He'll probably have reached a better position in the company.
* I think that the experienced candidate will perform much better; better quality, and faster work. He'll probably have reached a better position in the company.
* They'll perform more or less the same.

hypothesis: BS+MS no work experience ~ same hireability as a plain BS
BS+relevant work experience = more hireability than BS+MS without work experience

- Consider two candidates for the same job. One holds a relevant MS degree and no job experience. The other has
a BS and 2-years of relevant job experience. What do you think about the candidates' *hireability*?
* I think that the MS candidate will stand more chances
* I think the BS experienced candidate will stand more chances
* I think they're more or less equal from an hireability point of view

- Consider two fresh hires for the same position at the same company. One holds a relevant MS degree and no job experience. The other has a BS degree, and a couple of years of experience in a similar role. What do you think about the candidates' *skills* RIGHT AFTER BEING HIRED?
* I think that the MS candidate will perform much better; better quality, and faster work.
* I think that the BS experienced candidate will perform much better; better quality, and faster work.
* They'll perform more or less the same.

**** Qualitative survey: Find the Solution survey *****

- What do you think would be the solutions to reduce the skill gap for new graduates (both BS and post-graduate levels) entering the work force?

- In your opinion, how can students gain similar working experience during their *undergraduate* studies, if any? 


- In your opinion, how can students gain similar working experience during their *graduate* studies, if any? 


- In your opinion, what would be the benefits of joining a graduate-level *online* program?


- In your opinion, how a *graduate-level online* program can reduce the skill gap in industry and university for new graduates?


- In general, which statement is, in your opinion, is more accurate (if we assume both below groups have no previous job experience):
* The undergraduate students are already prepared to join the industry and they do not need a higher post-graduate degree.
* The post-graduate students are more competitive than undergraduate-level students and they have a higher possibility to be hired in a relevant company.




<potential ideas>:

- Tell us which of those statements are, in your opinion, true:
(MCQ)
* The tech industry is making a lot of money and it's contributing back very little to the education sector
* The universities should care more about research than practical industry applications
