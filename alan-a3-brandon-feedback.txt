Assignment 3 Feedback:

 

Good paper overall, there is one problem: I am not sure what you are citing or what you used from the papers you cited. You have one sentence that has multiple citations but it is unclear about what you cited. Please go back and expand a bit more on the background research.

Hello Brandon,

thanks for your feedback. I'll revise the "how to cite" post by David Joyner, but I think I understand what you're saying - I should say more something like "Research by X claims that [1]" rather than writing a phrase and then adding the references, right? I mean, a reader is not supposed to read the whole referenced paper.

 

I fear I may have done the same mistake in the qualifier question. I'll double check, you'll let me know if you think I'd better resubmit it before you check it (so you don't need to go through it twice), but I don't know whether this is against the rules.

 

About the mini-proposal, by the way: do you think it's in topic and feasibile within the timespan? I have a collaboration offer by another student, and I quite believe that "two" would be quite a perfect number for such research (more than two may be overkill, IMHO, since we're not developing a software or creating content).
