\section* {Project repository}

This is the repository that we used to share our work:\newline

\url{https://github.com/alanfranz/cs6460-teamcsse/}\newline

Some descriptions for relevant folders:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Exemplary Past Proposals}: Where we collected some of the examplary proposals, to use as a reference;
\item \textit{Final Project}: sources for the presentation and the final paper;
\item \textit{Milestones}: sources for milestones;
\item \textit{Survey Questions}: drafts for the survey;
\item \textit{data-analysis}: R scripts and cleaned data for the final paper; the \textbf{answers\_pare.R} script contains the data analysis, producing a series of dataframes holding the data counts and percentages, while the \textbf{plots.R} script contains the functions used to create the plots. Other experiments exist, there;
\item \textit{other-research-proposals}: some research proposal fetched from the class library; they were put here to read and find inspiration for the difficult part of creating our own proposal;
\item \textit{papers}: Most of the papers we've used in our proposal and final papers;
\item \textit{resources}: other resources we've read while trying to create our proposals;
\item \texit{bibliography.bib}: our compelte bibliography in biblatex format.
\end{itemize}
